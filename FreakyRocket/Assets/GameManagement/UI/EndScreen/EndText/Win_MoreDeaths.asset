  texts:
  - Ok, but were all these crashes necessary?
  - Finally! I thought you never pass it
  - I don't know whether to congratulate or sympathize
  - It's just luck, I guess
  - Congratulations, It looks like you were very lucky this time
  - All the time you wasted wasn't that much wasted
  - So it means you're gonna continue wasting time on the next level
  - You won, but at what cost
  - You are struggling, but still going
  - That was a long time
  - Better don't return to this one anymore
  - Congratulations! You can never see this level again
  - It took you so long, that my cactus withered
  - If every level is gonna take you so much time, you will never finish this game
  - You did it! But you know, it's ging to be harder?
  - It looks like all of these tries werent that pointless
  - You learn from mistakes
  - The counter below shows how many mistakes you have to make to finally succeed
  - At least all the pilots you sacrificed didn't die in vain
  - You didn't give up. Now you finished the level
