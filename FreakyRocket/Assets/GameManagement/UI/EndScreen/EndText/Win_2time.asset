  - First time was more impressive
  - Wasn't one pass enough?
  - Well, you did it, but why?
  - Congratulations! Another pass. As a reward you get... nothing
  - I guess you unlocked next level. Again
  - Nice! You beat it again
  - You won't get anything more from this level, no matter how may times you pass
    it
  - Now you see? Every time this level is the same
