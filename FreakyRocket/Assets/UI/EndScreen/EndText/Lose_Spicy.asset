  texts:
  - Maybe drink some melissa?
  - Could be better
  - Too hard?
  - Have you considered giving up?
  - Let me lower the difficulty... Just kidding, go on struggling
  - You struggle so hard. Too bad it's vain.
  - Calm down and think over your life decisions
  - You are still crashing
  - You should be bored by now
  - 'Did you know:

    If you hit meteor, you probably crash'
  - 'Did you know:

    Your goal is to get to Earth, not to a random meteor'
  - Imagine what if each time you crashed, one pilot would die
  - 'Did you know:

    The counter in the bottom right corner is NOT your score'
  - Maybe go get some help in the Internet?
  - It's not the best speedrun I have seen
  - Your death score it isn't praiseworthy
  - You are quite stubborn
  - Again the same...
  - Loss again and again. Maybe sometimes change something and win
  - Each loss wastes some of your time. Look at the counter bleow to know how much
    time have you already lost
  - Is crashing so funny you can't stand without it?
  - Maybe you are addicted to the meteors
  - Your deaths are getting boring
  - 'Did you know:

    You can''t pass level just by dying'
  - 'Did you know:

    If you don''t touch meteor, you won''t crash'
  - Everyone makes mistakes. Some just make them more often
  - Maybe you are stressed
  - Maybe there is a possibility that you pass this level in a far future
  - You aren't in shape, I guess
  - Each subsequent fail is more boring than previous. It already has acumulated
    a little
  - Why can't you just pass this level?
  - Are you trying to see all of the death phrazes?
  - Your explosion collection is already sizeable. You don't have to expand it
  - 'Did you know:

    Meteors are not collectable'
  - It is not the best speedrun I've seen
